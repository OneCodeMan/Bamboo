Easy
- Register form (form validation)
Around here, ask SO/ r/django how you'd use AJAX
to call to db to check for existing users
- Sign in form (form validation)
- New deck form
- New card form
- List of decks
- List of cards 
- Error page(s)

Medium
- Implement quiz maker
- Make forms better (i.e. extend amount of cards/decks user can make)
- Filter the queries. Don't have endless scrolling
